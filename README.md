This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.2.2.

## Development server

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Tips

There are two users available. One is admin and other one is manager. Currently the Admin has more functionalities.

To log in as a manager:
    "username": "managerIvan@asd123.bgg",
    "password": "hash_of_password"

To log in as an admin:
    "username": "adminMitko@asd123.bgg",
    "password": "hash_of_password"


In case you want to reload the data you can run node server.js again.

Happy navigating trough HCM!
